# types of operators:

# In Python, there are several types of operators:

# Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical operations.

# + (Addition)
# - (Subtraction)
# * (Multiplication)
# / (Division)
# % (Modulus)
# ** (Exponentiation)
# // (Floor Division)


# Comparison Operators: Compare values and return a boolean.

# == (Equal to)
# != (Not equal to)
# > (Greater than)
# < (Less than)
# >= (Greater than or equal to)
# <= (Less than or equal to)


# Logical Operators: Combine boolean expressions.

# and (Logical AND)
# or (Logical OR)
# not (Logical NOT)


# Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables.

# = (Assign)
# += (Add and assign)
# -= (Subtract and assign)
# *= (Multiply and assign)
# /= (Divide and assign)
# %= (Modulus and assign)
# **= (Exponentiate and assign)
# //= (Floor divide and assign)


# Bitwise Operators: Perform bit-level operations.

# & (Bitwise AND)
# | (Bitwise OR)
# ^ (Bitwise XOR)
# ~ (Bitwise NOT)
# << (Left shift)
# >> (Right shift)
